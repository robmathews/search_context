    #   Parsing documents into tokens. It is useful to identify various classes of tokens, e.g., numbers, words, complex words,
    #   email addresses, so that they can be processed differently.
    #   In principle token classes depend on the specific application, but for most purposes it 
    #   is adequate to use a predefined set of classes. PostgreSQL uses a parser to perform this step.
    #    A standard parser is provided, and custom parsers can be created for specific needs.
